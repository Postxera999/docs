To ensure the success of the project, ongoing and active involvement of key stakeholder departments is essential throughout each phase of the design, build, and implementation. The following outlines the types of support and participation expected from stakeholder users during the project lifecycle:
- Continued input from Customer Loyalty Department and other key stakeholders to further refine and (re-)prioritize business requirements throughout the project lifecycle.
- Participate in regular review sessions to provide feedback on key user flows, WCMP design elements and with content management capabilities to ensure the final solution deliver maximum usability and aligns with user expectations.   
- Contribute to the development of comprehensive UAT test scripts based on finalized business requirements and process flows, ensuring all critical scenarios and edge cases are covered for validation.  
- Support Quality Assurance (QA) and lead User Acceptance Testing (UAT) by executing test cases, logging defects, validating fixes, and confirming that the system meets business expectations before deployment.
- Participate in training activities by attending sessions, reviewing training materials, and preparing for effective use of the new system.
- Review and update Business Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to reflect changes introduced by the WCMP and CCMS, ensuring operational consistency and compliance post-implementation.
- Assist and support Go-Live coordination, including readiness checks, communication with end users and ensuring business continuity during the transition.
- Perform post-Go-Live verification, validating that key functionalities are working as expected in the live environment.
- Participate in the Post-Implementation Review (PIR) to evaluate project outcomes, gather feedback, identify lessons learned, and recommend improvements for future initiatives.
