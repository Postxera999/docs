DCA has developed the UXUI design based on business requirements that were primarily collected from Customer Loyalty Department, which is responsible for setting the vision and defining the detailed structure for the new Non-Gaming Loyalty Program design.

Additionally, input from other departments (listed below) played a crucial role in shaping the business vision by providing valuable insights into customer preferences, behaviours, interaction points, engagement methods, and operational processes.

**Departments:**
- Retail
- Hotel
- Food and Beverage
- MICE Operations
- Entertainment Services
- Integrated Resort Services
- Business Development
- Customer Experience Management
