This document specifies the functional requirements for the dining- and retail-related features of the Non-Gaming Loyalty WeChat Mini-Program (WCMP) and the Central Content Management System (CCMS). It is part of a broader series of Functional Requirements Specification (FRS) documents, each addressing distinct feature areas to guide the comprehensive development of the WCMP and CCMS.

The WCMP and CCMS together serve as core components of the company’s Non-Gaming CRM and Loyalty (NG CRM) Program, an initiative designed to enhance customer engagement through a loyalty program tailored specifically for non-gaming customers, a segment that has not previously been the focus of dedicated loyalty efforts.

The requirements outlined in this document are aligned with the UX and UI designs produced by DCA, which define the Mini-Program’s user flows, interface elements, and visual aesthetics.

In addition, this document outlines integration requirements for connecting the WCMP and CCMS with the NG CRM backend loyalty system and other existing transactional systems. It includes any necessary enhancements to support seamless data exchange and operational integration.

Overall, this specification serves as a blueprint for the development team, providing a clear understanding of the functional scope, feature set, and integration needs specific to the retail components of the WCMP and CCMS. It ensures that development efforts remain aligned with both strategic objectives and operational requirements.
