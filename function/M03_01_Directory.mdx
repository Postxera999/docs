</div>

Elements that cards may contain:
  - Promotional tags: When stores have promotions, display corresponding promotional tags, such as "R$ Rebate" or "2 Offers". **Business rules need further definition**

Clicking on any store card will jump to that store's detail page.

**Empty state: When search or filter results are 0, the empty state UI and text (such as "No results found") need to be designed.**
**Performance: Considering that the list may contain a large number of stores, a pull-to-load-more (or pagination) mechanism needs to be implemented to ensure page performance. Specific loading thresholds and quantities per load are to be determined.**
