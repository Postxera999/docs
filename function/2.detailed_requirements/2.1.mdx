title: "2.1 Dining and Retail Content Structures"

The image below presents the proposed high-level retail content structure, focusing on the key entities and their content integrations rather than detailing individual content type attributes, those will be covered in later sections of this document.

The dining content structure will follow a very similar format, with a comparable layout and organization.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>

As illustrated here, core data for the Merchant (Retailer or Restaurant), Member Privilege, and Coupon content types will be synchronized from the NG CRM system to the CCMS. Within the CCMS, this foundational data will be enriched with additional content, including location-specific details, opening hours, recommendations for similar merchants, and supporting assets such as text (e.g. titles, descriptions) and images.

The WCMP also requires a direct integration with the NG CRM system for real-time access to member data, specifically earned benefits, coupons, and segmentation tags. This data supports critical platform functionalities, such as coupon redemption, and drives personalized content delivery. To achieve this, a live user synchronization process is strongly recommended.

Several reusable content types and structures are associated with both Retailers and Restaurants. These include:

- Property content type
- Recommendations Specification
- Opening Hours Specification
- Location Specification, How-to-find Specification and Reference Location content type
- Opt-In Specification
- Coupon content type
- Offers content type
