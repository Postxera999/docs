title: "2.4 NG CRM to CCMS Coupon Sync Process"
---


NG CRM will provide a coupon synchronization API that supports a scheduled pull-based integration. CCMS will initiate periodic calls to NG CRM to retrieve the latest coupon data.

NG CRM supports a variety of coupon types, defined across the following dimensions:

- **Coupon Code Generation**
    - Internal: Coupon codes are generated within NG CRM
    - External: Coupon codes are generated by external systems (e.g. iCirena Cinema Ticketing System) and imported into NG CRM
- **Coupon Code Usage**
    - Individual: Each recipient receives a unique coupon code
    - Shared: All recipients share the same coupon code
- **Coupon Type**
    - Discount Coupons: Apply a discount to an order when redeemed
    - Single-use Value Coupons: Have a fixed monetary value, can be used once as full or partial payment, and are immediately marked as used (burned) upon redemption
    - Pre-Sale Access Code Coupon: Used for entertainment events to grant early access to purchase tickets for events before they become available to the general public.
    - Promotion Code Coupon: Redeemed through an external system. The benefits are defined outside the platform and may include more than just discounts or monetary value.
- **Validity Duration**
    - Fixed Period: Defined by a specific start and end date
    - Dynamic Duration: Expiry is calculated based on a predefined number of days from the time the coupon is claimed
- **Redemption Method Indicators**
    - Specifies whether the coupon can be redeemed online, offline, or both
    - For offline redemption, this setting specifies how the coupon code is presented: either as a QR code, a copyable code from the app or a PIN code required for redemption
- **QR Code Type**
    - Static QR Code: Remains unchanged and is suitable for certain offline redemption systems
    - Dynamic QR Code: Changes per use or session, depending on the system requirements for offline redemption

Once synchronized, the corresponding presentation elements and configuration settings for each coupon can be configured in CCMS.

For Hotel Coupons, these settings include specific parameters that restrict hotel search criteria during booking and include hotel list, booking date range, blackout dates, minimum and maximum length of stay, rate plan restrictions and rate plan display order.

The API response from NG CRM will include the following data elements for each coupon:

- Coupon ID – Unique Identifier for the Coupon
- Coupon Name – The internal reference name used within NG CRM
- Coupon Type – Indicates the type of coupon: Discount, Single-Use Value, Presale Access Code or Promotion Code Coupon.
- Coupon Value – Represents the value of the coupon:

    - For Single-use Value Coupons: A fixed dollar amount
- Redemption Method Indicators – Indicates whether the coupon is redeemable Online, Offline, or Both
- Offline Display Method – Specifies how the coupon is presented for offline use: as a QR Code, a Copyable Code or Redemption PIN Code (where a unique PIN is configured for each merchant in NG CRM for marking a coupon as redeemed)
- QR Code Display Method – Defines whether the QR code is Static or Dynamic
- Merchant Category List – A list of merchant categories where the coupon is valid (e.g., Dining, Retail, Entertainment, Cinema, Hotel)
- Merchant List – A list of specific merchants where the coupon can be redeemed
- Validity Duration (in Days) – Defines the number of days the coupon remains valid from the time it is claimed
- Validity Period – Specifies a fixed start and end date during which the coupon can be used
