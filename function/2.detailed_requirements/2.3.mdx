title: "2.3 NG CRM to CCMS Member Privileges Sync Process"
---

NG CRM will provide a member privileges synchronization API that supports a scheduled pull-based integration. CCMS will initiate periodic calls to NG CRM to retrieve the latest member privilege data.

Within NG CRM, member privileges are categorized as either:
- Discount Rules
- Point Earning Rules
- Point Redemption Rules

Once synchronized, the corresponding presentation elements and configuration settings for each member privilege can be configured in CCMS.

The API response from NG CRM will include the following data elements for each member privilege:

- Privilege Type – Indicates the type of privilege, which can be either Discount Rule, Base Point Earning Rule, Bonus Point Earning Rule, Redemption Rule
- Privilege Internal Name – The internal reference name used within NG CRM
- Merchant Category List – A list of merchant categories where the privilege is valid (e.g. Dining, Retail, Entertainment, Cinema, Hotel)
- Merchant List – A list of specific merchants where the privilege is available
- Status – Indicates whether the privilege is currently Active or Inactive
