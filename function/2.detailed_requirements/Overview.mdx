This section provides a detailed specification of the dining- and retail-related screens, content and functionality within the **Non-Gaming Loyalty WeChat Mini-Program (WCMP)**, along with corresponding features in the **Central Content Management System (CCMS)**. It outlines the core capabilities, behavioural logic and operational workflows that support dining- and retail-use cases within the broader loyalty program.

Requirements are structured according to the **DCA-designed page layouts**. Where design elements appear across multiple screens, their associated requirements are documented only once, within the section where they are first introduced. Subsequent references will point back to the original descriptions to avoid duplication and maintain clarity.
