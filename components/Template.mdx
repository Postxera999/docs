## **Overview**

1.  **Component Name:**
    * **Chinese Name:** (e.g., 按钮, 卡片, 模态框)
    * **English Name/Code Name:** (For development, e.g., Button, Card, Modal)
2.  **Component Description:**
    * Briefly explain the component's function, the problem it solves, and the scenarios where it is used.
3.  **Design Goal/Principles:**
    * The primary intent behind the component's design, such as improving efficiency, maintaining consistency, or ensuring accessibility.

## **Visual Reference and Embed**
### Figma/Design Tool Embed:
- Embed link or iFrame for the component in the design tool. (e.g., Figma embed link, Sketch Cloud link)
- Purpose: Allows users to view the latest design file and interactive prototypes directly within the documentation.

## **Design Specifications**

1.  **Structure and Composition:**
    * List the sub-elements/parts that make up the component (e.g., a button consists of a background, text, and an icon).
    * **Core Elements:** Describe the key constituent parts.
2.  **Size and Layout:**
    * **Fixed Sizes:** (e.g., specific width and height values for Small/Medium/Large sizes)
    * **Adaptive Rules:** Describe the component's responsive behavior and constraints across different breakpoints or content lengths (e.g., how the width adapts to its parent container).
    * **Padding and Margin:** Key spacing values (recommend using variables from the design system).
3.  **Color:**
    * Colors used and their corresponding design system variables (e.g., `--color-primary`, `--color-text-default`).
    * Color changes for different states.
4.  **Typography:**
    * Font, font size, and weight used (recommend using type scale variables from the design system).
5.  **Icons:**
    * If icons are used, specify their source, size, and alignment with the text.

## **States and Variants**

1.  **Standard States:**
    * **Default:** Initial state.
    * **Hover:** Visual changes when the mouse is over the component.
    * **Active/Pressed:** Visual changes when the component is being clicked/pressed.
    * **Disabled:** The state and appearance when non-interactive.
    * **Focus:** The appearance when receiving keyboard focus (important for accessibility).
2.  **Variants / Types:**
    * List the different types of the component (e.g., a button may have **Primary**, **Secondary**, **Ghost** types).
    * Provide a brief description and usage scenario for each variant.

## **Behavior and Interaction**

1.  **Primary Interactions:**
    * Describe how the component provides feedback after a user interaction (e.g., when clicked, the button's background darkens and an event is triggered).
2.  **Feedback and Validation:**
    * Whether the component needs to display error, success, or loading messages, and how these are presented.
3.  **Animation and Transition:**
    * If there are transition effects (e.g., color fade, position shift), describe the duration and easing curve of the animation.

#### **Usage Guidelines**

1.  **When to Use:**
    * Clearly indicate the **appropriate** scenarios for this component.
2.  **When Not to Use:**
    * Clearly indicate the **inappropriate** scenarios, discourage misuse, and suggest alternative solutions.
3.  **Content Guidance:**
    * Restrictions or suggestions regarding the text content and length within the component (e.g., button text should be concise, no more than 5 words).
4.  **Accessibility (A11Y):**
    * Explain how the component supports screen readers (e.g., necessary `aria-label`), keyboard navigation, high-contrast modes, etc.
