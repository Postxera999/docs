## **Design Specifications**

1. **Structure and Composition:**

   * Tab Bar (background and divider line)
   * Tab Item: Icon + Text Label
   * Active Item and Inactive Item
   * Related elements: bottom Home Indicator (iPhone), forming the bottom navigation area with the Tab Bar.

2. **Sizing and Layout:**

   * **Corner Radius:** Around `5px` (shown as `borderRadius: 5px` in component set)
   * **Background & Spacing:** Overall padding around `20px`; main container uses vertical layout with generous inter-section spacing (e.g., `gap: 100px` between info and example sections).
   * **Divider Line:** Bottom divider line color `#C6C8CC`, thickness around `1px`.

3. **Color:**

   * **Bar Background:** `#F0F2F5`
   * **Text and Icons:** Active state uses dark color (e.g., `#000000`); inactive state uses secondary text color (as defined in the design file).

4. **Typography:**

   * Tab labels use the design system’s text style (e.g., `Text 200 EN`) to ensure readability across resolutions and themes.
   * Section titles and examples use `SF Pro / 40 / Regular` (as specified in file header styles).

5. **Icons:**

   * Use SVG icons aligned horizontally with text; icon size and baseline alignment are managed by component constraints.

## **States and Variants**

1. **Standard States:**

   * **Default:** Inactive tab shown in secondary style.
   * **Active / Focus:** Current tab highlighted, icon and text in primary or dark color.
   * **Pressed:** Slight color or opacity change (per platform guidelines).
   * **Disabled:** Non-interactive tab with reduced contrast and no focus style.
   * **Keyboard / Accessibility Focus:** Visible focus ring or highlight to ensure accessibility.

2. **Variants / Types:**

   * Component set: `Tab bar`, includes the following focus variants:

     * `Property 1 = Home Focus`
     * `Property 1 = Discover Focus`
     * `Property 1 = Booking Focus`
     * `Property 1 = Reward Focus`
   * Each variant corresponds to a different active tab item: Home / Discover / Booking / Rewards.

## **Behavior and Interaction**

1. **Primary Interaction:**

   * Tapping a tab item switches the content panel, highlighting the selected tab.
   * On activation, icon and text color update accordingly, and trigger the corresponding route or content change.

2. **Feedback and Validation:**

   * Disabled tabs use the disabled state.
   * Light loading or transition feedback may appear during content switching (based on business needs).

3. **Animation and Transition:**

   * Color or opacity transitions should use 120–200 ms ease or ease-out curves.
   * Smooth transitions between tabs are recommended for natural and responsive interaction.

#### **Usage Guidelines**

1. **When to Use:**

   * For switching between top-level, mutually exclusive content such as Home, Discover, Booking, and Rewards.
   * Suitable for bottom navigation areas on mobile (iOS style).

2. **When *Not* to Use:**

   * For hierarchical or non-exclusive navigation (use side navigation or breadcrumbs instead).
   * When there are too many tabs (>5), avoid using a bottom Tab Bar.

3. **Copywriting Guidelines:**

   * Tab labels should be concise and clear, ideally within 2–3 words.
   * Use verbs or noun phrases; avoid ambiguity.

4. **Accessibility (A11Y):**

   * Provide each tab item with an `aria-label` or readable text.
   * Support keyboard navigation and focus highlighting.
   * Ensure readable text and distinguishable icons in high-contrast themes.
