## **Key Function**

The **Special Offers Carousel** displays the linked Offers content type linked to the page content. It allows users to browse the related offers such as hotel stays, dining, retail, and experiences related to the page.

---

## **Display Logic**

- If there is only one Offer configured to the content page, the offer card displays as a full width card
- If there is more than one configured offer, it is displayed as a card carousel
- The carousel is displayed when at least one Offer content type is configured on the page. Hidden automatically if there are no offers.
- The component retrieves offer data from the CCMS and only displays items that are both published and non-expired.
- Each carousel card links to the corresponding Offer Detail page.
