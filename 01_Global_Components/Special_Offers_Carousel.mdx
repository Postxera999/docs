The **Special Offers Carousel** displays promotional offers linked to the selected Entertainment Venue or Event. It allows users to browse featured offers such as hotel stays, dining, retail, and experiences related to the current venue or event. Used globally across **Venue Detail** and **Concert Detail** pages.

---

## **Display Logic**

- The carousel is displayed when at least one **Reference Offer** is configured in the _Entertainment Venue_ or _Entertainment Event_ content type.
    
- Hidden automatically if there are no active or published offers.
    
- The component retrieves offer data from the CCMS and only displays items that are both **published** and **non-expired**.
    
- Each carousel card links to the corresponding Offer Detail page.
    
- Offers exceeding the display limit automatically enable horizontal scrolling.
