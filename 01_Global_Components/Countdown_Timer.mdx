## Display Logic

- Visible only when a **future Sale Schedule Item** exists and the current time is within the `Countdown Start in Hours` range.
    
- Pulls content from **Sale Schedule Item**:
    
    - `Countdown Label Text`
        
    - `Countdown Start in Hours`
        
- Hidden once sale begins or if pre-sale is managed externally.
    
- Shown on both **Directory tiles** and **Detail pages**.
    
- If a **Coupon ID** is configured for pre-sale, countdown is visible only for eligible users.
    
- When countdown reaches zero, display `"00 days"` before switching to active sale state.
