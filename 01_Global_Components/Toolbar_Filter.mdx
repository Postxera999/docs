GLOBAL_ACTION_Toolbar(FilterBar)
```

The **Toolbar (Filter Bar)** is a global control strip located at the top of the Venue Directory and Retail pages. It provides users with quick access to **sorting**, **filtering**, and **search** actions to refine the displayed content.

---

## Display Logic

- Displayed persistently at the top of the page when listings are scrollable.
    
- Contains global actions for **Sort**, **Filter**, and **Search**.
    
- Triggers corresponding modals or inputs when tapped.
    
- Hidden on pages without filterable or sortable content.

- When the user taps **Sort** or **Filter**, a bottom modal appears, allowing the user to perform the corresponding actions.
    
- When clicking the **Search** icon, the search input box displays directly under the filter bar.
    
- Syncs current search and filter state with content listing below.
