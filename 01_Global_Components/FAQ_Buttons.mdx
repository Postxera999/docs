The **FAQ Section** is a global component used to display frequently asked questions for events, venues, or promotions. It provides users with quick access to common information such as entry rules, refund policies, and event-specific reminders. Displayed consistently across the **Concert Detail** and **Venue Detail** pages.

---

## Display Logic

- The FAQ section becomes visible when at least one FAQ entry is linked to the content record in the CCMS.
    
- Automatically hidden when no FAQ data exists.
    
- Each FAQ entry expands or collapses when tapped, revealing its full answer text.
    
- Supports inline links for related sections (e.g., “Need to Know” or “Ticket Policy”).
    
- Displays in vertical list format; each FAQ entry contains a **question** and **answer** pair.
