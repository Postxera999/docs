## Display Logic

- The Share button is a consistent button style across the MP, usually placed next to a Contact button.
    
- Share Image Poster
    
    - The share image is generated using the content's key visual as the image, and the title and description of the content type.
        
    - A default image should be configured if no key visual is attached to the content.
        
    - A WeChat QR code that links to the shared content is placed in the bottom right of the share poster.

## Interaction Logic

- When tapped, a modal containing the 3 sharing options appears.
    
- Share to Wechat: Shares the MP content page as an MP card
    
- Share to Moments: Directs to post on WeChat Moments with the share image poster
    
- Save Image: when tapped, displays the share image poster with option to `[Save to album]` or `[Cancel]`. Users can save the share poster image to album by long pressing the image poster or tapping `[Save to album]`
