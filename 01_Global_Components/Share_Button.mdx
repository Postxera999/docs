```Plain
GLOBAL_ACTION_ShareButton
```

The **Share Button** provides users with the ability to share the venue or event page externally through supported WeChat sharing functions. Used globally across **Venue Detail** and **Concert Detail** pages to maintain consistent sharing capability across entertainment-related modules.

---

## Display Logic

- Visible when the page is loaded within the WeChat Mini-Program environment.
    
- Hidden when accessed outside of the supported platform or when sharing is disabled.
    
- On tap, triggers the **WeChat native share action**, automatically fetching the configured title, image, and link from the CCMS data for the current Venue or Event.
    
- The shared content uses the following mapping:
    
    - **Title** → from _Short Title_ of the content type
        
    - **Description** → from _Description_ field of the content type
        
    - **Image** → from _Hero Image_ or _Tile Image_ field
        
    - **Link** → dynamically generated deep link for the corresponding Venue or Event page
