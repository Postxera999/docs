In our frontend project, we use two mechanisms — **Lazy Loading** and **Skeleton Screens** — to address both **loading performance** and **user experience** challenges. They serve distinct roles at the architectural level:


## **Skeleton Screen**

A Skeleton Screen is a state management and UI rendering mechanism aimed at improving perceived performance and user experience.

  

**Core Purpose:**

Enhance user perception — instead of showing a traditional loading spinner or blank space, skeleton screens provide a low-fidelity preview of the page’s eventual structure, making the wait feel shorter.

  

**Layout Stability:**

Before the data or component finishes loading, the skeleton pre-occupies the exact layout space required by the final content.

  

## **Lazy Loading**

  

**Lazy Loading** is a resource loading strategy designed to solve performance issues.

**Core Purpose:**

Reduce initial load requests — it significantly decreases the burden on first render by deferring the loading of non-critical resources (such as off-screen images, component code chunks, or route modules).
