The **Location Card** displays the venue’s key location details including its name, address, and geolocation coordinates. It helps users identify where the venue is located and provides a quick link to open the location on the map. Used globally across **Venue Detail** and **Event Detail** pages wherever location information is required.

- The **Open Map** button or link directs the user to a full map view with the venue’s coordinates.
    
- Supports both embedded map preview and external map redirection depending on configuration.
