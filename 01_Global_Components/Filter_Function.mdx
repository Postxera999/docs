## Filter Results Logic

  

After the user taps the “Confirm” button at the bottom of the Filter modal, the system follows the logic below:

1. Results Screen (When Matches Are Found)
    
    1. Display the store card list content. For details, refer to section M03-01-03 Store Card List.
        
2. No Results Screen (Search - No Results)
    

- Display default 'No Results' state
    
- Recommended Content (You Might Also Like):
    
    - Displayed below the “No Results” message is a list of other recommendations for other content from the same module.
        
    - The recommendations in the "No Results" page is personalised based on the user's customer profile (from CDPMA data) and the content should reflect the items within the same module.
