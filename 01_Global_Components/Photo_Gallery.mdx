The **Photo Gallery** component displays a carousel or grid of venue images, allowing users to preview the location and facilities visually. Shared globally across **Venue**, **Event**, and **Concert** modules to ensure design consistency.

---

## Display Logic

- Loads images from the **CCMS linked gallery field**.
    
- Supports both swipe and tap-to-expand views.
    
- Hidden automatically if no image is configured.
    
- Maintains consistent image aspect ratio and rounded corners.
