import { FigmaEmbed } from '/snippets/FigmaEmbed.jsx';

```Plain
GLOBAL_DISPLAY_RelevantInfo
```

  

The **Relevant Info** component displays key informational content related to the venue or event, such as house rules, contact info, or accessibility details. This component ensures important visitor notes remain visible and structured.

---

## Display Logic

- Displays when the **Relevant Info** content field is populated in CCMS.
    
- Content supports formatted text (paragraphs, bullet points, links).
    
- Auto-hides when the content field is empty.
    
- May include collapsible accordion behavior for long text entries.
