## Display Logic

- The component is the header image card on the top of all detail pages.
    
    - If the first asset is a video, the video will be autoplayed upon entering the page
        
- If there is an image gallery associated with the detail page:
    
    - There will be a photo album icon displayed at the bottom right that will open into the full page image gallery
        
    - The order of images in the carousel corresponds to the order of images in the carousel
        

---

## Interaction Logic

- If there is an image gallery linked with the detail page:
    
    - The header image becomes a carousel and is swipeable.
        
    - Tapping on the image will open the image/video in full screen
        
- If there is only one image/video, the image is not tappable
