The **Contact Button** is used to display a quick-access contact option for the Entertainment Venue or Event. It retrieves information from the **Contact Specification** configured in the CCMS and opens the assigned contact channel when tapped. Displayed consistently across **Venue Detail** and **Concert Detail** pages.

---

## **Display Logic**

- The button is visible only when a **Contact Specification** is linked to the corresponding Venue or Event content type.
    
- Hidden automatically if no contact data is configured.
    
- On tap, the user is directed to the contact method defined in the specification (e.g., phone number, email, or website link).
    
- When multiple contact methods exist, the system prioritizes the default or primary entry as configured in the CCMS.
