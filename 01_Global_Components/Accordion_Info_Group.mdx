```Plain
GLOBAL_CTNR_AccordionInfoGroup
```

The **Accordion Info Group** displays grouped informational content in expandable sections. Each accordion item can be expanded or collapsed to show details related to the selected category, such as **How to Find**, **Transportation**, **Restroom**, and **Need to Know**. Used globally across **Venue Detail** and other informational pages to organize long-form content into structured segments.

## Display Logic

- Always visible when at least one **Accordion Info Item** is configured in the associated content type.
    
- Hidden automatically if no items are configured.
    
- Each accordion item displays a title and collapsible content area.
    
- Only one accordion section may be expanded at a time (auto-collapse on new open).
    
- Text, lists, and links within the content area follow standard body text formatting.
