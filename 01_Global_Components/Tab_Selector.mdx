The **Tab Selector** component is used to navigate between content sections within the **Venue Detail** and **Concert Detail** pages. It provides a simple horizontal tab layout that allows users to switch between predefined sections such as **Offers**, **Shows**, **Location**, and **Notes**.

---

## Display Logic

- Always visible directly below the main venue header card.
    
- Displays all configured content sections in order as defined by the page layout.
    
- The active tab is visually highlighted to indicate the current section.
    
- When a user taps on a tab, the view automatically scrolls to or loads the corresponding content section.
    
- The component supports both scrollable and fixed tab layouts depending on the number of items configured.
