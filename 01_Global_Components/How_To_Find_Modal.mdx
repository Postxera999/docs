---

import { FigmaEmbed } from '/snippets/FigmaEmbed.jsx';
  

```Plain
GLOBAL_DISPLAY_HowToFindModal
```

## Key Function

This is a **popup modal component** that appears when a user clicks on a station in the route details (such as in **TripDetailsStepper**). It provides **detailed location guidance** for that station, including descriptive text and images.

## Visual Reference

<FigmaEmbed url="https://www.figma.com/design/EHB41JQIomI0iwPWzaXAkw/-Dev--NGMP-UXUI-Designs?node-id=7539-22985&t=TmrwzwgJVnbh1PL8-0" />
## Field List

| Fields          | Description                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| howtofind_text  | Descriptive text guiding the user to locate the place. |
| howtofind_image | Illustrative image showing how to find the place.      |

## Display Logic

- The component appears as a **full-screen or bottom popup modal**, overlaying the current page.
- The modal title should display the location name (retrieved from `station` information linked to address data).
- The content includes both `howtofind_text` (text guidance) and `howtofind_image` (image guidance).

## Interaction Logic

- When a station in **TripDetailsStepper** is clicked, the system loads data based on the associated `howtofind_id` and triggers this modal to appear.
