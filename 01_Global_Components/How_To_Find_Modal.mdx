## Key Function

- The How to Find component aims to provide visual representation and a guide on how to locate the venue.
    
- The idea is to use images of key landmarks around the Galaxy property as a visual reference to find the place, such as Diamond Lobby, with some descriptive text on where the venue is in reference to the landmark.
