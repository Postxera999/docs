The **You May Also Like Carousel** is a global component that displays recommended or related events at the bottom of the page. It enhances user engagement by encouraging further browsing of upcoming shows or promotions related to the current content. Displayed consistently across **Entertainment**, **Venue Detail**, and **Concert Detail** pages.

## Display Logic

- Appears when related content or recommendations are configured in the CCMS.
    
- Each carousel card displays event image, title, and short description.
    
- Hidden automatically when no related content is available.
    
- Clicking a card navigates users to the linked detail page (e.g., another concert or venue event).
    
- Supports both **manual swipe** and **auto-scroll** interactions for carousel navigation.
