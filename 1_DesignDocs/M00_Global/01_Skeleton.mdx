In our frontend project, we use two mechanisms — **Lazy Loading** and **Skeleton Screens** — to address both **loading performance** and **user experience** challenges. They serve distinct roles at the architectural level:

## Skeleton Screen

A **Skeleton Screen** is a state management and UI rendering mechanism aimed at improving **perceived performance** and **user experience**.

**Core Purpose:**
Enhance user perception — instead of showing a traditional loading spinner or blank space, skeleton screens provide a low-fidelity preview of the page’s eventual structure, making the wait feel shorter.

**Layout Stability:**
Before the data or component finishes loading, the skeleton pre-occupies the exact layout space required by the final content.


## Lazy Loading

**Lazy Loading** is a resource loading strategy designed to solve performance issues.

**Core Purpose:**
Reduce initial load requests — it significantly decreases the burden on first render by deferring the loading of non-critical resources (such as off-screen images, component code chunks, or route modules).
