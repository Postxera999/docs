After the user taps the “Confirm” button at the bottom of the Filter modal, the system follows the logic below:
1. Results Screen (When Matches Are Found)
    - Display the store card list content. For details, refer to section M03-01-03 Store Card List.
2. No Results Screen (Search - No Results)
- Display default 'No Results' state
- Recommended Content (You Might Also Like):
    - Displayed below the “No Results” message is the Retail module card carousel, displaying a list of other recommendations for other retail stores.
    - The recommendations in the "No Results" page is personalised based on the user's customer profile (from CDPMA data). This Retail carousel should be the same as the retail carousel displayed on the Homepage.
