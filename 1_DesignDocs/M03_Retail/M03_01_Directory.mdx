### **M03-01-01 Store Card List**

#### **Results count**

Result Count Display provides users with a summary of the total number of stores matching the currently applied filters or search criteria. It appears above the store card area on the Retail Directory Page.

#### **Display Logic**

- The Result Count Display is shown whenever the store list is generated or refreshed.
- The count value reflects the total number of store cards matching the active filtering and/or search criteria.
- Display format:
    - “xx results” — where _xx_ represents the number of stores matching the active filtering and/or search criteria.
- If no stores match the applied criteria, the display reads “0 results”, and the list area transitions to the empty state layout.
- The count is updated in real time whenever the user:
    - Applies or removes filters
    - Executes a store name search

#### **Store list**

The Store List Display presents the set of retail outlets that match the currently applied filters, sorting options, or search criteria.

Each store is rendered as an individual Store Card, displaying key information such as logo, name, operational status, category, location, and available benefits.

**Display Logic**

- The Store List appears directly below the Result Count Display.
- Each Store Card represents one merchant record retrieved from the CCMS dataset.
- Cards are listed vertically with standard spacing and rounded container styling.
- The list updates dynamically when:
    - Filters or sorting options are changed
    - Search keywords are applied

### **M03-01-02 Store Card**

Each Store Card represents an individual retail merchant entry within the Retail Listing Page.

It consolidates essential merchant information into a single, compact layout, allowing users to quickly identify store identity, category, location, and active offers.

#### **Key Function**

- The Store Card is a reusable content component displaying a retailer’s name, logo, category, location, current operating status, and active benefits such as NG$ Rebate or Offers.
- It dynamically updates according to user filtering, sorting, or search actions.
- The card also provides direct navigation to the detailed merchant view upon user interaction.

#### **Behavior Logic**

- Tap on Card: Opens Store Detail Page for selected merchant
