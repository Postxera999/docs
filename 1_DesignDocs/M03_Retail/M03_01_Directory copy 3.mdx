##### **Filter Results Logic**

After the user taps the **‚ÄúConfirm‚Äù** button at the bottom of the Filter modal, the system follows the logic below:

1. **Results Screen (When Matches Are Found)**
    
    1. Display the store card list content. For details, refer to section M03-01-03 Store Card List.
        
2. **No Results Screen (Search - No Results)**
    

- **Status Message**:
    
    - **Main Title**: **No Results**
        
    - **Description Text**: `Please try searching for other content.`
        
    - **Purpose**: Clearly informs users that the current filter combination returned **no matching stores**.
        
- **Recommended Content (You Might Also Like)**:
    
    - Displayed below the ‚ÄúNo Results‚Äù message is a **‚ÄúYou Might Also Like‚Äù** recommendation section.
        
    - **Purpose**: Provides **alternative suggestions** to retain user engagement and help users discover relevant content when no results are found.
        
    - **Recommendation Logic (assumed)**: May be based on user browsing history, current location, or a relaxed version of the active filters (e.g., retaining only the store category).
        
    - **Example**: The figure shows recommended stores such as **Rimowa**, **Aesop**, and **Apple Store**.
        

#### **Search**

Search logic: The specific logic of the search function needs to be clarified, such as whether it‚Äôs fuzzy matching or exact matching, and whether the search scope is limited to store names only or includes store categories, descriptions, etc.

##### **Search Entry and Interface States**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Feature**|**Description**|
|**Entry Point**|Located below the navigation bar in the main **Shopping Directory** screen, to the right of the **Recommended** (Sort) and **Filter** buttons. The search area contains a **magnifying glass icon (üîç)** and a **text input field**.|
|**Trigger Action**|Activated when the user taps the search field or begins typing text.|
|**Interface Behavior**|The main page remains visible while typing. A ‚Äú√ó‚Äù (clear) button appears on the right side of the input field, allowing the user to **clear the search input with one tap**.|
|**Scope**|The search is performed **within the currently selected category** (e.g., **Retail** as shown in the example).|

##### **Search Result Handling Logic**

  

After the user enters a search keyword, the system executes the search and displays different results depending on whether matches are found:

| **Scenario**     | **Result**                                                                                        | **UI Behavior**                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Results: Yes** | The **Shopping Directory** list refreshes to display **only stores matching the search keyword**. | The search keyword remains visible in the input field; matching stores are shown in the list.                                     |
| **Results: No**  | The main list displays a **‚ÄúNo Results‚Äù** state screen.                                           | A ‚ÄúNo Results‚Äù message and hint text are shown at the center of the screen, with the entered keyword retained in the input field. |

##### **Search Results Screen (When Matches Are Found)**

- **List Content**:
    
    - Each list item clearly displays the store name (with matched keywords possibly **highlighted**), store logo, open status, promotions, and category.
        
    - **Duplicate Matches**: Multiple entries of the same brand (e.g., several **Canada Goose** locations) can appear if they match the search criteria.
        

##### **No Results Screen (Search - No Results)**

- **Status Information**:
    
    - **Main Title**: **No Results** (displayed below the search icon).
        
    - **Hint Text**: `Please try searching for other content.`
        
- **Search Keyword Persistence**: The entered keyword (e.g., `Ca`) remains visible in the input field, allowing users to modify it directly.
    
- **Recommended Content**: Although not fully shown in the diagram, based on the **Filter - No Results** design pattern, a **‚ÄúYou Might Also Like‚Äù** section is expected below the ‚ÄúNo Results‚Äù message to retain users and encourage content discovery.
    

#### **Sort**

- **Status Feedback**:
    
    - **Operating Hours**: Immediate feedback through text color (e.g., red for `Closed Now`) and textual cues.
        
    - **Offers / Rebates**: Highlighted tags (e.g., `NG$ Rebate` or `2 Offers` with yellow/brown backgrounds) draw attention to the store‚Äôs value propositions.
        
- **Clickability**: The entire card area is clickable, navigating the user to the **Store Detail Page** to view complete information, including products, promotions, address, and contact details.
