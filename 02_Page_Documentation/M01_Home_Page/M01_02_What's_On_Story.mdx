|   |   |
|---|---|
|Fields|Description|
|`main_media`|URL of the main visual media (image/video) used to showcase the core visual element of the experience in full screen.|

  

### Display Logic

  

- The component should display full-screen (or occupy the main visual area, adapting to different device ratios), positioned at the lowest content layer.
    
- If the media is an image, display in `cover` mode, and automatically switch to the next story after 5 seconds.
    
- If the media is a video, autoplay it and switch to the next story after playback finishes.
    
- A transparent top navigation bar displays the current playback progress.
    
- Each What's On carousel can include multiple stories, but the CTA remains the same.
    
      
    

### Interaction Logic

  

- Users can manually swipe or tap to view other stories.
    
- Each story displays one banner at a time.
