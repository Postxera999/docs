### **Field List**

| Fields              | Description                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |

| taxi_hotlines_text  | Displays the hotline number.                     |

### **Display Logic**

- Each phone number is displayed with a phone icon for visual clarity.

### **Interaction Logic**

- Tapping a displayed phone number (e.g., **+853 8500 0000**) triggers the device’s native phone dialer with the number pre-filled.

| location   | The specific pick-up/drop-off location within the hotel.    |
| hotel_logo | The logo image of the hotel.                                |

### **Display Logic**

- This list appears directly below the `TaxiContactBlock` under the title _“Taxi pick-up & drop-off address”_.
- Each row represents a property/hotel associated with a taxi stand.
- The row shows the hotel name and a brief location descriptor (e.g., _Diamond Lobby_).
- The display order of the list is fixed.

### **Interaction Logic**

- Tapping a row (e.g., _Galaxy Hotel_ or _The Ritz-Carlton, Macau_) triggers the _“How to Find”_ modal sliding up from the bottom of the screen. This modal loads content via `howtofind_id`, including text instructions and an image (`howtofind_image`).
