## 1. Transport Service Selector

```Plain
TRANS_SELECT_TransportServiceSelector
```

### Key Function

This section serves as a navigation component at the top of the page, allowing users to select between different types of transportation services (e.g., Shuttle Bus, Express Limousine, etc.). It presents these options in tab or button format, enabling users to quickly switch and view details of different transport services.

### Visual Reference

<FigmaEmbed url="https://www.figma.com/design/dogOPeGxUe0sjpG2jGnayE/NG-MP-UI-Phase-1?node-id=2498-38045&t=bip98WRSXpXtfcVX-4" />

### Field List

| Fields                   | Description                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `transportation_options` | Key-value list that configures various transportation service options.       |
| `transportation_title`   | Display name shown on the selector, such as “Shuttle Bus” or “Limo Service.” |
| `transportation_type`    | Type identifier mapped to the specific transportation card type and style.   |
| `transportation_status`  | Enabled or disabled status of each transport card.                           |

### Display Logic

- The component is located at the top of the page, right below the page title, and displayed as a horizontally scrollable card list.
- It renders all **active** button cards based on the configuration of `transportation_options` and `transportation_status`.
- The display order of the buttons follows the `transportation_order` field.
- The currently selected `transportation_title` is highlighted or marked as active.
- When the number of `transportation_options` exceeds the display width, users can scroll horizontally.
- Component visibility is controlled by the `transportation_status` value.

### Interaction Logic

- When users swipe left on the navigation, the page content remains unchanged.
- When users select a navigation item, the main content area dynamically loads and displays the corresponding `transportation_type`.
- When the second or subsequent navigation items are selected, the container automatically scrolls left until the last navigation item aligns with a 16px right margin.
