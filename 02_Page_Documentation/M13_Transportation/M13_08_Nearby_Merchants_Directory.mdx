## 1.  Toolbar (Filter & Search)

```Plain
GLOBAL_ACTION_Toolbar(Filter Bar)
```

This component is a variant of the global component [Toolbar](/01_Global_Components/ToolBar#Filter-Search).

### **Key Function**

This section allows users to efficiently find transportation routes or station information that meet their needs through keyword search, multi-dimensional filtering, and sorting features.

The component includes a **Filter**, **Search** button, and two **quick filter options**.

### Field List

| **Fields**        | **Description**                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| merchant_category | The primary business category or industry classification of the merchant. This field serves as the main basis for filtering and categorizing the merchant list. |
| merchant_location | The merchant’s primary geographical location or a description of its specific location within the venue.                                                        |

### Display Logic

- The component is fixed at the top of the page for immediate accessibility.
- It consists of a **Search Input Field** (for keyword search) and a Filter Button, and two quick filter tags (Category, Location).
- The search input box should display a placeholder text (e.g., "Search for a store or cuisine").
### Interaction Logic

- When the user types in the **Search Input Field** and submits, the **Merchant List** below updates dynamically to show matching results for the content type.
- When the user taps the **Filter/Sort Icon/Button**, a bottom modal or new page appears, allowing the user to perform filtering and sorting actions (e.g., filter by Category, Location, Service, Sort by Distance, Name, Popularity).

### Field List

Note: Since specific merchant fields are not in the provided Field List, I will use fields from `location Info` and `How To Find` tables which relate to location and discovery.*

| **Fields**        | **Description**                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| merchant_category | The merchant’s primary business category or industry classification. This field serves as the main basis for filtering and categorizing the merchant list. |
| merchant_name     | The name of the merchant.                                                                                                                                  |

### Display Logic

- Each **Merchant Card** represents one merchant record retrieved from the data source (CCMS/PIM).
- Cards are listed vertically and .
- The list updates dynamically when:
    - Filters options are changed.
    - Search keywords are applied.
- If no results are found, a "No Results" message should be displayed.
- merchant_name：Maximum 2 lines, truncate if more than 2 lines

### Interaction Logic

- Tapping on any area of the **Merchant Card** (except for specific action buttons like a "View Details" link, if present) navigates the user to the **Merchant Detail Page**.
