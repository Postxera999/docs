### 3.4 Sale Schedule

```Plain
ENT_DISPLAY_SaleSchedule
```

**Key function:**

Galaxy occasionally implements phased ticket sale strategies to manage demand and provide targeted access for high-interest Entertainment Events. These strategies often include multiple exclusive pre-sale periods followed by a public sale.

  

Sale phases may include:

- _Galaxy-Managed Pre-Sales_: Pre-sale access is controlled through Galaxy’s ticketing platform. Entry is granted via access codes embedded in NG CRM coupons, allowing targeted groups (e.g. Diamond-and-above-tier members) to purchase tickets before public availability.
    
- _Externally Managed Pre-Sales_: Some pre-sales are handled outside Galaxy’s ticketing ecosystem, such as through Damai or Ctrip. These pre-sales utilize alternative external mechanisms (e.g. an artist’s Weverse fan club site) for distributing access codes and, as such, cannot be managed through NG CRM and WCMP.
    
- _Exclusive Member Sales_: Similar to pre-sales, these events are restricted to specific member groups and require access code coupons to complete the purchase.
    
- _Public Sales_: Tickets are made available to all users without access restrictions. Sales may occur across one or multiple ticketing platforms, depending on the event’s distribution strategy.
    

#### Field List

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Fields|Description|
|title_text|Each Sale Schedule is assigned a meaningful name to help content managers easily identify and associate it with the corresponding Entertainment Event.|

|sale_end_date|Defines the end date and time for ticket sales within a Sale Schedule Item.|
|subtitle_text|The subtitle text is displayed below the Sale Schedule window.|

#### Display Logic

- Each Sale Schedule Window is displayed as its own line item.
    
- `title_text` is displayed as the left-column header
    
- `sale_start_date` / `sale_end_date`are displayed as the primary text style in the right-column.
    
- `subtitle_text` is displayed as the secondary text style if configured
    

  

- _Sale Schedule Item Name_ – Each Sale Schedule Item must be assigned a meaningful name to help content managers easily identify and associate it with the corresponding Entertainment Event.
    
- _Sale Start Date_ – Defines the start date and time for ticket sales within a Sale Schedule Item. This value is not only displayed across various pages but also used to sequence Sale Schedule Items, determining the order in which associated labels and promotional banners are presented.
    
- _Sale End Date_ – Defines the end date and time for ticket sales within a Sale Schedule Item. Sale schedule dates and times are displayed according to the following rules:
    
    - _No end date and time_ – Starting Month Day, Year Time (e.g. Starting November 15, 2025 14:00)
        
    - _Same start and end date with different times_ – Month Day, Year Time1 - Time2, Time3 (e.g. November 15, 2025 14:00 – 16:00)

    - _Multiple dates and times_ – Display on separate lines.

|banner_cta_button|Optional CTA button in relation to the banner|

### Display Logic

- Banners can be configured according to specific conditions, including:
    
    - Signed out: When users are not signed in, the banner could have a CTA prompt to get users to sign up to become a member to view perks
        
    - Locked promotion: When users are not eligible for the presale, display information on how they could get access
        
- Once the user has a presale coupon, the perks are 'unlocked' and the corresponding banner is hidden
    
- If a `banner_cta_button` is configured, it will display at the bottom of the banner by default.
    

### Interaction Logic

- If there is more than 1 banner configured for the same entertainment event, it displays as a carousel:
